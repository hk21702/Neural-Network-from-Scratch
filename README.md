# Neural Network from Scratch
Project for Senior Options - 2020

Trying to create a basic neural network from scratch showing all of the different portions without using many libraries.

Code based on https://mlfromscratch.com/neural-network-tutorial/#/

2 hidden layers + input and output layers

Softmax for output layer normalization

4 different activation algroithims:
    Swish
    E-Swish
    Relu
    Leaky Relu
    Sigmoid
